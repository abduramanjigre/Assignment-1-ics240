This Java project was developed for my ICS 240: DSA course. It focuses on implementing and testing core DSA concepts through an object-oriented restaurant management system. The program reads restaurant data from a text file, stores it in an array-based list, and allows various operations such as adding, removing, and displaying restaurant items.
